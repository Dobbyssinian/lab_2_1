# My Project Plan (Level 1 Heading)
***Note:*** This document is written merely as an illustrative example, and dose not provide any working guide to an actucal project.

### Proposal (Level 3 Heading)
---
I am planning to make a computer vision software that detects objects in images.
In order to build it, I will use opencv, deep learing libraries, such as [My GitHub adress](TensorFlow) or [My GitHub adress](PyTorch), and other open source softwares.

For example, the objects in the following images were detected using [My GitHub adress](mmdetection):

### Dependencies (Level 3 Heading)
- python
- opencv-python
- tensorflow
- openmmlab
- package manager

### Installation
In a bash terminal, run the following commands (**Do NOT actually run this commands in your computer**):

'''sh
$ sudo apt update
$ conda creat -n cv_detection
$ conda activate cv_detection
$ python --version
$ python example.py
'''
